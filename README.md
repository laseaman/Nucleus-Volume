Nucleus-Volume
==============
Analysis is performed by AnalyzeShape.m starting with ellipsoid axis lengths and creating the figures from the paper "Periodicity of nuclear morphology in human fibroblasts" by Seaman et al, 2014.

Helper function SKL.m computes the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler Divergence of two matricies or vectors.

Helper function findAB.m performs the basis fitting for a specified frequency.

Both are used by AnalyzeShape.m and should be stored in the same folder.
